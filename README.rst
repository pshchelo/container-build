**THIS REPOSITORY IS RETIRED**

Its last state is still accessible via ``git checkout HEAD^``, but be warned,
it is most probably not working already.

It has been split out (keeping history) to separate repositories:

alpine-jupyter-minimal-py3, alpine-jupyter-sci-py3

    https://github.com/pshchelo/docker-jupyter-py3-alpine

mcp-pkg-check

    https://github.com/pshchelo/docker-mcp-pkg-check

keystone-federation
